📊 Sales Performance Dashboard:
A Power BI dashboard for analyzing sales trends using customer segment and product pitching.

📝 Overview:
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize the tour package dataset sales for customer behavior and pitching insights. The goal is to provide insights that help in decision-making and performance tracking.

The dataset used in this project contains tour package details, which include almost 5000 records. The first page includes customer segmentation- age group, designation, gender, marital status, and occupation- with KPIs and charts to help users easily interpret the data. The other page includes pitching insights which helps to see how pitching duration, pitch satisfaction scores, and number of follow-ups with customers impact tour package sales.
